# CSC488/homework03 Using Pytest and JSON

Python script: This script determines the turbidity of a sample of water, prints if the sample is safe for consumption and returns how many hours it takes for the water to become drinkable. Data is import from a JSON file containing a list of dictionaires; two functions are used one to calculate turbidity and another to calculate hours of decay necessary. 

Python script 2: This script is a set of tests for script 1 (space water turbidity). Using the PYTEST framework this script contains a list of sanity tests.
